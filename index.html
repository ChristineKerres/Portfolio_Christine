Wouldn't it be more efficient to change ourselves to be independent from the environment. Thinking about evolution, why can't we decide what color we're going to adopt/wear next? Why don't we program the future by anticipatory adaptation of our human bodies to the unstoppable future changes in our environment? Why don't we get ahead of evolution? Why not become independent of evolutionary changes?

        <br> Considering Franco Berardi's review of our world as "the century with no future", the reduction of our space to 1.50 meters during the Covid-19 crisis awakes sleeping skills of dreaming and imagining alternative realities. The future as a passive experience has evolved into a reality full of visions for the future. During lockdown many of us found the time to reflect on their own situation and to redefine their secret desires and hopes for the future. We want to preserve this little flame of revolutionary energy of those past times and let visionary thoughts continue to flourish at least in this protected personal breeding ground of pandemic dreams.
